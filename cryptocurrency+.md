* Ethereum
    * introduce Not only transaction but store executable program
    * smart contract
    * run the application in everyones computer rather than from on server
    * Decetralize
    * Super Big Computer

* Smart Contract
    * A program(code) that can go with blockchain
    * Turing Complete(anything you can think of or write the code) (bitcoin doesn't support turing)
    * solidity has looping system (bitcoin dont support loop beacuse of high execution time in blockchain)
    --
    * Everyone get's the history of small contract like blockchain
        * History of all transactions
        * Current state of all smart contract
        * https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/smart-contracts-for-dummies-a1ba1e0b9575/

* Dapps(Decentralize Application)
    * Interface (frontend and backend) , smart contract is like an API.. communicate with frontend and backend
    * smart contract likely let user to communicate with blockchain 
    * https://steemit.com/ (A decentralize application) web3 version of social platform

* Ethereum virtual machine & Gas:
    * Some Issues
        * What if some code virus in smart contract
        * What if code of Infinite loop
        * What if code about private things like webcam
    * Ethereum:
        * A virutal machine for every user who will signup with ethereum
        * Smart contract not actually run on your computer but in virtual machine..so it's not interacting with your personal computer.
        --
        * If you use smart contract, you need to pay. (GAS)
        * So, if you write a infinte loop in your smart contract and you have let's say 1 ether. you will have 0 ether in no time. and you cant use and you will loose your ether. [please write efficient code=smart code = "SMART CONTRACT"]
    
* DAOs(Decentralized Autonomous Organizations)
    * Code smart contract in a way that it can run itself without human interaction.
    --
    * To Solve DAO attack
        * Soft and Hard Folks(Upgrade the software)
            * Ethereum Classic (who didn't upgrade)
            * Ethereum (who did upgrade)

            * For Bitcoin--(segregated witness)
            * Bitcoin cash (blocksize 8MB no seperate signature)
            * Bicoin Gold (GPU mining available)
            * Bitcoin (segregated witness still apply,NO GPU mining only asics)
        
* ICOS (Initial Coin Offering)
    * In ICOS public dont get share like IPOS
    * GET TOKEN
    * Founder gets all the share
    * Give COIN and GET Token (store token or sell token)
    * No mining only for fund rising issue
